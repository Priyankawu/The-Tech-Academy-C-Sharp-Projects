*Twenty One Card Game*

This project is a Twenty One Card game where the winner is one who gets cards with the sum of 21. This is a comprehensive project with several classes interacting with each other, providing good practice in several C Sharp concepts as enums, structs, dictionary, virtual methods, operator overloading and constructor overloading.


*Car Insurance*

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes userâ€™s input on policy information and calculates a quote on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

*Code First Database *

This project is a Console Application built with the .NET Framework. It uses the Code-First Approach, where classes for the domain are created first and the Entity Framework API creates the database based on the domain classes. 

*News Letter*

This project is an MVC web application that allow the user to sign up for the newsletter. It takes user input through a form and stores it in the database using the Entity Framework. It has the functionality of adding and unsubscribing users.


*Sorted Sentence*

This project does the logic of taking a sentence and returning one where all words that begin with a lower case letter are at the beginning of the sentence, sorted in ascending order followed by all words that begin with an upper case letter, sorted in descending order.
